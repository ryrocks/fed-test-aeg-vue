        The way ingredients are sourced affects the way we nourish
        our bodies. Author Mark Schatzer believes our body naturally
        develops an appetite for the foods and nutrients it needs to
        be healthy, but that artificial flavourings are getting in the
        way. This can be reversed by focusing on high-quality ingredients
        and being mindful as your appetite guides you to consume according
        to your body’s needs.

        Sourcing local or organic food is a good way to start being more
        mindful about what you’re cooking and eating.
